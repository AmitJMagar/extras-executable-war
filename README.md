# Executable WAR header
This module defines the 'main' method for a self-contained web application that kickstarts
embedded [Winstone](http://github.com/jenkinsci/winstone) and runs a web application without
needing a servlet container.

See Jenkins war module for how this module gets used by a .war file.
